# Project: Markdown-to-HTML Converter

## Environment
- Python virtual environment at .venv/ (already created)
- Run all Python commands with: .venv/bin/python
- Run tests with: .venv/bin/python -m pytest -v --tb=short
- Do NOT install any packages. No pip install. Standard library only.

## Workspace Rules
- test_converter.py is PRE-WRITTEN and defines your acceptance criteria. Do NOT modify it.
- All source code goes in the markdown_converter/ package directory.
- The public API is: from markdown_converter import convert

## Workflow
1. First: read test_converter.py to understand what's expected
2. Run pytest to see all failing tests
3. Implement modules one at a time: lexer.py, parser.py, inline_parser.py, renderer.py, converter.py, __init__.py
4. Run pytest after each module to check progress
5. Fix failures with targeted patches, not full file rewrites
6. Stop when all tests pass

## If Retrying After a Previous Attempt
- Files from the previous attempt may already exist in markdown_converter/
- Run pytest FIRST to see which tests already pass
- Do NOT rewrite files whose tests are already passing
- Focus only on files that are missing or whose tests fail
